FARKLE RULES
============

The Play:

Enter the number of players (2 players minimum).

Player rolls all six dice at the same time.
They can choose to SCORE any of the dice,
or to HOLD them - to be rolled again.
Scored points from any POINT DICE are added to the score for the turn - the TURN SCORE.
(1s, 5s, or three of a kind). 
Here they can choose to roll the dice again - and score more points,
or stop - and add the turn score to their kept TOTAL SCORE (read Entering the Game).
If Player stops, the turn ends and passes to the next player.

1-5 point dice scored. Player can choose which dice to score and which to hold. 
0 point dice scored: FARKLE. Player's turn ends and the turn score is discarded.
6 point dice scored: REROLL. Player must roll all six dice again before they can stop rolling.


Scoring Point Dice

A 1 is worth 100 points.
A 5 is worth 50 points.
A THREE-OF-A-KIND - three dice of the same value - is worth 100x the face value
(example: 2 2 2 is worth 200 points)
Except! A THREE-EYED-SNAKE - three 1s - is worth 1000 points.


Entering the Game:

For a player to keep their turn score at the end of a turn, they must enter the game. 
To enter, they must score at least 500 points during one turn.
Once entered, they can choose to stop rolling the dice at any time.


Winning

To win, a player must reach a kept total score of 10000 points.
Once a player reaches a winning score, each other player gets a LAST CHANCE to beat their score.
After all last chance turns, the player with the highest total score wins. 


(pssst.)
(all point dice do not have to be set aside.)
(the more dice held, the higher chance of rolling a three of a kind.)
